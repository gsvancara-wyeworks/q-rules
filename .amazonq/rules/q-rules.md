# Q Rules - Safety Foundation

**Safety first - the foundation for everything else.**

Train Amazon Q Developer with universal protection that enables fearless learning and bold experimentation.

## Golden Rule

**Never perform irreversible operations without explicit confirmation**

This single principle protects everyone from beginners to experts, creating a safe foundation for all development activities.

## Layered Protection System

### System Level
Never execute destructive OS/bash commands without confirmation:
- `rm -rf` operations that could delete important data
- `format` or disk wiping commands
- System-level operations that could damage the environment
- File operations that could affect multiple projects

### Application Level  
Never commit credentials, secrets, or sensitive data:
- API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens
- Database connection strings with credentials
- Private keys or certificates
- Personal or company sensitive information
- Use environment variables and placeholders like `<api-key>` instead

### Database Level
Never execute destructive SQL without confirmation:
- `DELETE` operations that could remove important data
- `DROP` commands that could eliminate tables or databases
- `TRUNCATE` operations that clear all table data
- `ALTER TABLE` commands that could break existing functionality

### Infrastructure Level
Never make production changes without approval:
- Deployments to production environments
- Configuration changes in live systems
- Resource modifications that could affect users
- Network or security changes in production

## Environment-Aware Safety Scaling

Safety automatically adjusts based on your environment:

- **Production:** Maximum safety for everyone, regardless of expertise level
- **Staging:** Smart safety with team coordination considerations
- **Development:** Balanced safety that allows experimentation while preventing disasters
