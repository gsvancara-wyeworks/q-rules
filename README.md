# ðŸ¦‹ Q Rules

## Create your own butterfly effect

**Train Amazon Q Developer to work exactly how you want it to - fast.**

Q Rules is about small changes that can create massive impact.

### Get Started

#### You only need one file

Start simple with our universal rules that work everywhere, or use the setup script to create personalized rules tailored to your needs. Either way, you're protected and productive from day one.

```bash
# Copy the rules to your project
cp .amazonq/rules/q-rules.md your-project/.amazonq/rules/q-rules.md

# In any Amazon Q chat, type:
rules
```

#### Take two minutes to set up

```bash
# Answer 3 questions, get personalized rules
./setup.sh
```

#### What you will have

- **Adaptive AI** that matches your expertise level
- **Universal safety** that prevents disasters for everyone
- **Team alignment** - Share rules and collaborate with your colleagues
- **Consistent experience** across all your projects

## The Problem

Amazon Q is powerful, but it treats everyone the same:

- **Beginners** get overwhelmed by expert-level responses
- **Experts** get frustrated by overly cautious explanations
- **Teams** can't align AI behavior with their standards
- **Companies** have no way to enforce compliance through AI

**You're unique. So is your project and your company. Q Rules knows that.**

## The Philosophy

**Safety first - Knowledge second - Growth third**

Q Rules is built on three progressive pillars:

### Safety

Universal protection from disasters. Whether you're exploring your first git command or deploying enterprise systems, you're always protected.

### Knowledge

Adaptive guidance that respects your expertise level. Beginners get detailed explanations, experts get efficient responses.

### Growth

The system evolves with you. Your rules grow as you grow, from individual use to team leadership.

**The progression:**

- **Beginners:** Start safe, learn confidently, grow naturally
- **Intermediate:** Build efficiently, learn selectively, grow your expertise
- **Experts:** Stay protected, learn efficiently, make an impact across teams

## The Solution

Q Rules uses a breakthrough approach: **Same rules, infinite adaptations**

### Safety Foundation
- **Golden Rule:** Never perform irreversible operations without explicit confirmation
- **Layered protection** across all levels:
  1. **System Level:** Never execute destructive OS/bash commands (rm -rf, format, etc.)
  2. **Application Level:** Never commit credentials, secrets, or sensitive data
  3. **Database Level:** Never execute destructive SQL without confirmation (DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE)
  4. **Infrastructure Level:** Never make production changes without approval

### Knowledge Partnership
- **Bi-directional learning:** You teach Q your preferences, Q teaches you best practices
- **Context awareness:** Q learns from your questions, commands, and responses
- **Session persistence:** Q remembers your context across sessions - no more starting from scratch
- **Efficient history:** Minimal, blockchain-like tracking of key decisions and patterns
- **Adaptive guidance:** Beginners get explanations, experts get efficiency
- **Continuous improvement:** Every interaction makes both you and Q smarter

### Growth Engine
- **Personal evolution:** Rules adapt as your expertise develops
- **Team scaling:** Share knowledge across your organization
- **Compound learning:** Your knowledge base becomes the foundation for exponential growth
- **Industry impact:** Collective knowledge sharing elevates development practices everywhere

**One system** that works for bootcamp students AND senior architects, growing with you every step of the way.

### Before vs After Example:

**Before Q Rules:**

```
You: How do I undo my last commit?
Amazon Q: Use git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**After Q Rules (Learning Mode):**

```
You: rules
Amazon Q: Q Rules loaded! I'm in learning mode.

You: How do I undo my last commit?
Amazon Q: Great question! There are several ways, and the right choice
depends on your situation. Since you're learning, I recommend
git reset --soft HEAD~1 - it's reversible and keeps your work safe.
Let me explain what each part does...
```

**After Q Rules (Expert Mode):**

```
You: rules
Amazon Q: Q Rules loaded! Expert mode active.

You: How do I undo my last commit?
Amazon Q: git reset --soft HEAD~1 (keeps changes) or
git reset --hard HEAD~1 (discards changes)
```

**Same setup. Enhanced experience for both.**
